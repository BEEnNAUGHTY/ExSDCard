### Hello !

### Short explanations
Since Nougat, many apps (old and recently) cannot longer read/write propeply on external SDCard, its due to 6.0 permissions storage updates/changes.

So apps devs must update to date their apps, or you must change your habit, that isn't cool.

With the v3, the modification script has been completly review and tested. However, the Oreo version is always under development, sorry for the delay. I work hard on it.

**The new access path for your external SDCard: /mnt/media_rw/SDCARDNUMBER/

Due to some users bugs reports, its seems that on some ROMs/kernels, its impossible to take into account the changes made to the proper xml file without toggler the SELinux from enforcing to the permissive mode.
Its that why i have added two versions with one wich contain the SELinux toggler (in other words: two Magisk Modules in one).
