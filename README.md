### Short explanation
#### This module will give you a new path to your external sd card storage with all necessary R/W access permissions.

#### The new access path for your external SDCard: /mnt/media_rw/SDCARDNUMBER/

###### A little note: if with this module you get access permissions issues, just install the ZIP version with SELinux toggler on the XDA thread.
