### Hello !

### Short explanation
#### This module will give you a new path to your external sd card storage with all necessary R/W access permissions.

#### The new access path for your external SDCard: /mnt/media_rw/SDCARDNUMBER/

###### A little note: if with this module you get access permissions issues, just install the ZIP version with SELinux toggler on the XDA thread.

v3.3:
- Oreo support enhanced
- "ExSDCard.config.txt" file configuration moved into post-fs-data stage, no more need to be configured by users and easily to coded
- SELinux support is now integrated in the main ZIP, so no more two ZIPs versions
- "ExSDCard.O.*.applist.txt" config file(s) no longer needed
        Instead of => a simple file called "ExSDCard_Oreo_apps" put in "/Magisk/ExSDCard/" with all apps packages names that need Oreo specials permissions (one by line)
